            <p>Space tourism is no longer science fiction. With private companies leading the charge, civilian space travel is becoming a reality, opening up new frontiers for human exploration and adventure.</p>
            
            <h2>Current State of Space Tourism</h2>
            <p>Several companies are now offering or developing different types of space experiences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Suborbital flights: Brief experiences of weightlessness</li>
                <li>Orbital tourism: Multi-day stays in Earth orbit</li>
                <li>Lunar tourism: Planned missions around the Moon</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Leading Companies</h2>
            <p>Private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are pioneering different approaches to space tourism, from rocket launches to spaceplanes. Each offers unique experiences and perspectives on space travel.</p>
            
            <h2>Training and Requirements</h2>
            <p>While early space tourists needed extensive training, new vehicles are designed for civilian use with minimal preparation. However, participants still need to meet certain health and fitness requirements.</p>
            
            <h2>The Cost Factor</h2>
            <p>Currently, space tourism is limited to the ultra-wealthy, with prices in the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. However, companies are working to reduce costs and make space travel more accessible.</p>
            
            <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>
            <p>As space tourism grows, there's increasing focus on its environmental impact. Companies are developing more sustainable propulsion systems and reusable vehicles to minimize their carbon footprint.</p>
            
            <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
            <p>The future of space tourism could include orbital hotels, lunar bases, and even Mars visits. As technology advances and costs decrease, space travel might become as common as international air travel is today.</p>
